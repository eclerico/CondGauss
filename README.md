This repository contains PyTorch code for the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11886.pdf">Conditionally Gaussian PAC-Bayes</a>.

A novel PAC-Bayesian training method is implemented.

There are a few examples of how to run the code in the `main.py` script.

For any question, feel free to contact me.
